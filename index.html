  <p class='info'>
  To break out into the software development field.
  I'm aiming to be a competitive full-stack developer, willing to learn any framework to get the best results.
  My background is uniquely focused on theoretical maths and fun-optimized design, which I tend to leverage on any project that I get involved with.
  To put it simply:

    Surprise. I programmed and designed this bad boy from scratch.
    It uses HTML, CSS, Javascript, and jQuery. I think button clicks are very satisfying, so I wanted to design a page without scrolling as a study.
    The verdict? You get good viewpoint control, but it isn't easy to account for different resolutions and scrolling is a great tool for reading.

      Made entirely in Python. Yeah, big mistake. A modest video game demo where I learned the coding magic behind cutscenes,
      transitions, command responses, etc. Basically, if there's any more going on than a sprite existing in the window, I had to figure out. Terrible way
      to make a game, but great way to learn the mechanics and appreciate how far tech has come.

      This is my baby. Art, code, most sound tracks and effects, design, etc. is all mine. It was a really serious undertaking and I'm
      happy with the direction its going in. It is created in the engine GameMaker: Studio, which uses its own custom language and file system.
      I'm not really comfortable outing the engine files, but as you can imagine there are an astronomical amount of moving parts to manage objects,
      transitions, and long-term data.

      I still have to select which projects I'm actually putting up and have to retrieve them from my VM. Amongst other things, I've got some cool
      algorithms, some web crawler stuff, even an almost-functional IM service with both client and server communication.

      <br>
      Once I knock this off (very soon), I'll be starting a new project. The going idea is making a mobile app, using the Ionic framework,
      that aims to systematically solve behavioral problems that arise when trying to plan group activities. It means I'll have to learn Angular, so that's neat.

  Videogames are my first true love. I've done work in every part of the development cycle, and I'm a particular fan of 2D, indie,
  pixel art games. This means that I have several points of inspiration that I can look towards when creating a congealed,
  inviting user experience from the bare minimum.

  Music has always been a pastime of mine. I was raised on classical piano, but have recently been trying my hand at jazz and electronic.
  Here are some tracks I made for my videogame: one cover, one original. They're created using a program that simulates sound chips
  from the classic Nintendo era. As in life, I'm willing to learn anything to hit a high benchmark.
