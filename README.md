# React Native & Redux Mobile Flashcards, an Udacity Project

An old 'portfolio site' of mine. Not much going on, but I like a lot of the ideas here.

## What I learned

Doing some abstract things with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I went for a more modern design, but without any of the modern know-how. I had to be scrappy to make it work. 


## What could be improved

Responsive design!!! The presentation on this site suffers pretty seriously on any monitor that isn't my own (though on mine, it looks pretty good). If I were to rehash it, I would at least put every main 'page' into a flex box and center it.

Design paradigm. I like this idea on a computer, but it absolutely fails on a mobile device. Sure, this could be chalked up to 'responsive deisgn as well', but it would need a pretty large overhaul to be effective on mobile.
